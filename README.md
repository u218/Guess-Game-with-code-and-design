# Guess-Game-with-code-and-design
In this game, the player is asked to guess a number that has been randomly generated by the computer. The player is given a certain number of chances to guess the correct number, and they are told whether their guess is too high or too low each time they make a guess. If the player guesses the correct number, they win the game. If they run out of chances before guessing the correct number, they lose the game.

To start the game, the computer generates a random number between a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100). The player is then prompted to make their first guess. The player's guess is read in from standard input, and is compared to the random number. If the player's guess is too high, they are told to try again with a lower number. If the player's guess is too low, they are told to try again with a higher number. The player is given a certain number of chances to make a correct guess, and the game ends either when the player guesses the correct number or when they run out of chances.

To implement this game in C++, you would need to use functions and control structures such as loops and conditional statements to manage the flow of the game. You would also need to use C++ functions and libraries to generate random numbers, read in input from the user, and output messages to the player.
